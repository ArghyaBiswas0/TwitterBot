# TwitterBot
A Twitter bot with Python using the Selenium library that gets you followers. The bot searches for a hashtag, pulls up all the tweets related to the hashtag and automatically likes the tweets at regular intervals.  

To download Selenium library : 
Open Terminal and type - pip install selenium

(Though this method doesn't guarantee more followers, I was able to get 23 followers in one week for the demo account I created to test the code)
